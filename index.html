<header><h1>Introducing the Politically Somewhere Test!</h1></header>
<p>This test is still under construction, so if you are here and are not a part of the building process, congratulations!
    Check back later for the completed version, or if you'd like to contribute, contact me through the github repo.

    This test aims to correct many of the problems other political placement tests experience, such as false binaries, conflating axes,
     failing to differentiate between personal and political positions, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, this test may seem a bit more complex than others you are used to.  But first off, you need to choose a version to take. 
    <br>If you are curious about what this text measures, the axes it uses, etc. scroll down below the version for a detailed explanation.
</p>
<h2>The Normal Version</h2>
<p>This version will be similar to 8values and 9axes in how questions are presented.  Additionally, you will be presented a popup after each
     question asking you how important the preceding question was to you.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Nuanced Version</h2>
<p>This version is rather different in how you answer it.  Following each question will be a 2D 5x5 grid.  The Y-axis is measure of 
    agreement, the X-axis is measure of importance.  Simply click the square in the grid that is closest to how much you agree with 
    each statement and how much you care about it in general.

<h1>What's Going On?</h1>
<p>This test measures your responses along many different axes: 29 to be exact.  However, these axes are condensed into 11 categories.
    Following the quiz, you will be able to see your scores on all of these axes as well as several plottings on a 2D political compass.
    There will be two compasses that are relatively familiar to most people along with a third one that uses a more nontraditional way
     of defining the axes.  Finally, the test will attempt to guess an ideology closest to your positions.  Note: this final feature is a work 
     in progress and may not accurately reflect what you actually believe.
